"""The "S" in SOLID stands for the Single Responsibility Principle. This principle says that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, it should be responsible for just one specific part of the systemâ€™s functionality. When a class does many different things, it becomes hard to understand, maintain, and modify. By following SRP, the code becomes more organized, easier to test, and easier to evolve, because each class has a well-defined role."""
