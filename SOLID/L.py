"""The "L" in SOLID stands for the Liskov Substitution Principle. This principle says that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without altering the programâ€™s behavior. In other words, if a child class inherits from a parent class, it must maintain the same expected behavior, without causing errors or unexpected results. This guarantees that the system is more reliable and easier to maintain."""
